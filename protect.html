            <h2>Oceans cover more than 70% of the planet and are home to important species and ecosystems<br>
                 that we rely on for food, livelihoods, climate regulation and more. But the oceans need our help.</h2>
            <P>Saving the oceans can sometimes feel like an overwhelming task, but if we all pitch in, we can make a big difference. While there are a variety of lifestyle choices that, <br>
                when adopted, can help the oceans, here are our top 10 ways you can help save the oceans! </P>

            <h2>TEACH KIDS ABOUT THE OCEANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT</h2>
            <p>Around the world, research has shown that children have limited knowledge about the oceans because marine science topics are absent in most school curricula.<br>
                 The oceans are critical to life on Earth. Understanding that at an early age can help kids form connections with the seas and understand the reasons why it’s so important to protect them. <br>
                 Check out the Kids Environmental Lesson Plans (KELP) from Sailors for the Sea and dive into Oceana’s Marine Life Encyclopedia to learn about our oceans and all animals that inhabit them.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-5">
            <h2>LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND</h2>
            <p>As beach crowds increase, so does the amount of trash left behind or blown away. Don’t let your day outside contribute to the destruction of our oceans. <br>
                Remember to leave nothing behind but your footprints — collect and properly dispose of your trash. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-6">
            <h2>DEMAND PLASTIC-FREE ALTERNATIVES </h2>
            <p>The oceans face a massive and growing threat from plastics. An estimated 33 billion pounds of plastic pollution flood our marine environment from land-based sources every year — that’s <br>
                roughly equivalent to dumping two garbage trucks full of plastic into our oceans every minute. And, instead of degrading, plastic breaks up into smaller and smaller pieces that are swallowed by everything from fish and sea turtles to seals and seabirds, many of which are endangered! </p>

        <div class="container-7">
            <h2>CONTACT YOUR REPRESENTATIVES AND LAWMAKERS</h2>
            <p>Your representatives and lawmakers might not know how important these issues are that face our oceans. But they will if you tell them.<br>
                 It’s up to constituents like you to make lawmakers aware of the crises facing marine life and our oceans.<br>
                  Don’t be shy! Take action with Oceana to directly contact your government representatives and lawmakers.    </p>

            <h2>EAT RESPONSIBLY-SOURCED SEAFOOD </h2>
            <p>Choose seafood that is healthy for you and the oceans from well-managed, wild fisheries. Wild seafood is a renewable resource that requires minimal freshwater<br>
                 to produce and emits less carbon dioxide than land-based proteins like beef. We know it’s hard to know what fish are okay to eat, which is why you can turn to these helpful resources: </p>
